# desktopDeleter
JS program that deletes a file or folder on your desktop.

**You must have Node JS installed to run this program!**

## How to use

Download the file and place it either in the folder where you would like to delete or onto the desktop.
**I recommend placing the javascript file onto your desktop and having the folders/files you would like to delete be on the desktop as well.**

Open up your local terminal and type this command.
```
cd Desktop
```
This will open the terminal to the directory where you can run the program. 

Call the program by typing.
```
node delete.js
```

After this the program will prompt you with questions on what file or folder you would like to delete. 

## TroubleShoot

Since this is a work in process there will be some inconvient processes. 

If you would like to delete file from a folder then you will need to type in the folder along with the file.
This should look something like this.
```
What is the name of the file? folder/filename
```
